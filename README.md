## **Conclusion**
Using the outlined data preprocessing techniques and machine learning models, we successfully enhanced the prediction of B-cell epitopes in bioinformatics. By addressing class imbalance through SMOTE, removing outliers using Isolation Forest, and selecting the most relevant features with SelectKBest, we built models that provided meaningful and accurate predictions.

The hyperparameter-tuned SVM model, which achieved an ROC AUC score of 0.567 and a test accuracy of 58.4%, showed better generalization compared to other models like Random Forest. This performance indicates a significant step toward identifying B-cell epitopes with reliable accuracy. The success of this model directly supports the problem statement by enabling more accurate and efficient prediction of epitopes, which are crucial for vaccine development and immunological research.

In conclusion, using these advanced techniques and models, we effectively addressed the challenge of epitope prediction and demonstrated the potential for machine learning to accelerate the design of targeted vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.
